    <h1>Difference of Var, Let and Const with example</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <h4>Var  ==></h4>
    <p>Var are used for variable declaration in Javascript. Var is function scoped. It can be said that variable with 
        var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.</p>
    <h4>Let  ==></h4>
    <p>Let is used for variable declaration in Javascript. Let is a block scoped.</p>
    <h4>Constant  ==></h4>
    <p>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces. 
       However if a variable is defined with keyword const, it cannot be reassigned. “const” cannot be re-assigned to a 
       new value. However it CAN be mutated.</p>
